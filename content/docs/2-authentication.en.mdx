# Authentication

The DVoice TTS API uses token-based authentication. You must include a valid API token in all requests to the [Single Endpoint](./4-single) and [Streaming Endpoint](./5-stream).

## Obtaining a Token

1. Visit [profile.dvoice.uz](https://profile.dvoice.uz).
2. Log in with your DVoice account credentials.
3. Navigate to the API section to generate or copy your API token.
4. Store the token securely.

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not share your API token publicly. Regenerate it at
  [profile.dvoice.uz](https://profile.dvoice.uz) if compromised.
</Callout>

## Authenticating Requests

### Single Endpoint (HTTP)

Include the token in the `token` header of your HTTP POST request to `/tts`.

**Example Header**:

```
token: <your-token>
```

### Streaming Endpoint (WebSocket)

Include the token in the `token` header when connecting to `wss://oyqiz.airi.uz/stream`.

**Example Connection** (raw WebSocket):

```
GET wss://oyqiz.airi.uz/tts/stream
token: <your-token>
```

When using SDKs, configure the token during client initialization ([SDK Usage](./3-sdks)).

## Authentication Errors

| Status/Code | Message                                | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 401         | Invalid Token                          | The token is invalid or expired. |
| 403         | A token is required for authentication | No token was provided.           |

For WebSocket connections, invalid or missing tokens result in a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response, and the connection closes ([Error Handling](./6-errors)).

## Notes

- Tokens include a user ID and token name, validated server-side.
- If you encounter `401 Invalid Token`, verify your token at [profile.dvoice.uz](https://profile.dvoice.uz).
- See [Error Handling](./6-errors) for more error details.
