# Speech to Text

DVoice provides robust speech-to-text (STT) capabilities, enabling you to convert spoken audio into accurate text transcriptions. This feature is powered by a single endpoint designed for ease of use and automatic language detection when needed.

## API Reference

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed instructions on using the STT endpoint, including authentication,
  supported audio formats, and error handling, refer to the [API
  Reference](../../api/stt/single).
</Callout>

## Endpoint Overview

The STT functionality is accessible via a POST request to the `/stt` endpoint. This endpoint processes audio input and returns the transcribed text along with performance metrics.

## Input Requirements

- **Audio Input**: The endpoint accepts audio files submitted as `form-data` with the field name `audio`. Supported audio formats will be detailed in the API Reference.
- **Optional Language Field**: A language parameter can be specified; if left empty, the system automatically detects the language of the audio.

## Response Structure

The endpoint returns a JSON object with the following fields:

- **transcript**: A string containing the transcribed text from the audio.
- **inference_time**: A number representing the time taken (in seconds) to process the audio and generate the transcription.

## Usage Notes

- The STT model is optimized for accurate transcription, with language detection as a fallback when no language is specified.
- Performance may vary based on audio quality and length.
- **Billing**: Charges are calculated based on the duration of the audio processed, measured in seconds.
