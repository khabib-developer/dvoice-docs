This guide addresses common issues you may encounter while using DVoice’s text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) services.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS) Issues

### Issue: Audio Output is Silent or Distorted

- **Possible Cause**: The input text contains unsupported characters or an incompatible model/format is selected.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure the text uses supported characters and languages (e.g., Uzbek for "Iroda" or "Surayyo_v2").
  - Verify the `format` parameter (e.g., "mp3", "wav") is correct.
  - Test with a simple input like "Haq olinur, berilmas" to isolate the issue.

### Issue: 429 Too Many Requests Error

- **Possible Cause**: Exceeded the 60 requests per minute limit per API token.
- **Solution**:
  - Check your usage in the [dashboard](https://voice.airi.uz).
  - Wait for the `Retry-After` header time before retrying.
  - Reduce request frequency or contact support for custom limits.

### Issue: WebSocket Connection Closes Unexpectedly

- **Possible Cause**: Network instability or hitting the rate limit during streaming.
- **Solution**:
  - Confirm a stable internet connection.
  - Ensure you’re within the 60 requests per minute limit.
  - Restart the stream with valid `text`, `model`, and `format` parameters.

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Issues

### Issue: Transcription is Inaccurate or Empty

- **Possible Cause**: Poor audio quality, background noise, or exceeding the 5-minute audio duration limit per minute.
- **Solution**:
  - Use high-quality audio with minimal background noise.
  - Check the audio duration against the limit in the [dashboard](https://voice.airi.uz).
  - Resubmit a shorter or clearer audio file.

### Issue: 429 Too Many Requests Error

- **Possible Cause**: Exceeded the 5-minute audio duration per minute limit per API token.
- **Solution**:
  - Monitor your audio usage in the [dashboard](https://voice.airi.uz).
  - Wait for the `Retry-After` header time before retrying.
  - Submit shorter audio segments or space out requests.

### Issue: Upload Fails with 400 Bad Request

- **Possible Cause**: Invalid audio format or missing `audio` field in `form-data`.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure the audio file is in a supported format (e.g., "mp3", "wav").
  - Confirm the file is named `audio` in the request.
  - Refer to the [API Reference](https://voice.airi.uz/docs/api/stt/single) for details.

## General Issues

### Issue: 403 Forbidden Error

- **Possible Cause**: Invalid or expired API token.
- **Solution**:
  - Regenerate your token in the [dashboard](https://voice.airi.uz).
  - Update your application with the new token.
  - Store the token securely to prevent expiration issues.

### Issue: Slow Response Times

- **Possible Cause**: High server load or network latency.
- **Solution**:
  - Retry the request after a brief delay (e.g., 30 seconds).
  - Contact support at [voice.airi.uz](https://voice.airi.uz) if the problem persists.

### Issue: Connection Timeout

- **Possible Cause**: Unstable network or temporary server downtime.
- **Solution**:
  - Verify your internet connection stability.
  - Check the DVoice service status on [voice.airi.uz](https://voice.airi.uz).
  - Retry after a few minutes if the issue is server-related.
