# Authentication

The DVoice API employs token-based authentication. A valid API token must be included in all requests to both the Text to Speech and Speech to Text endpoints.

## Getting a Token

1. Go to [voice.airi.uz](https://voice.airi.uz).
2. Sign in using your DVoice account details.
3. Access the API section to create or retrieve your API token.
4. Keep the token secure and private.

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid sharing your API token publicly. If it’s compromised, regenerate it at
  [voice.airi.uz](https://voice.airi.uz).
</Callout>

## Making Authenticated Requests

### Single Endpoint (HTTP)

Add the token in the `token` header of your HTTP POST request.

**Example Header**:

```
token: <your-token>
```

### Streaming Endpoint (WebSocket)

Include the token in the `token` header when establishing a connection to the stream URL.

**Example Connection** (raw WebSocket):

```
token: <your-token>
```

When using SDKs, set the token during client setup (see [SDK Usage](../developer-guide/sdk-libraries)).

## Handling Authentication Errors

| Status/Code | Message                                | Description                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 401         | Invalid Token                          | The token is either invalid or has expired. |
| 403         | A token is required for authentication | No token was included in the request.       |

For WebSocket connections, an invalid or missing token triggers a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response, followed by connection closure.

## Additional Notes

- Tokens contain a user ID and token name, verified on the server side.
- If you receive a `401 Invalid Token` error, check your token’s validity at [voice.airi.uz](https://voice.airi.uz).
